CONTENT:

This repo contains the following folders/sub-folders:

+ Training
+ Test
	+ AUTH	
	+ DEL
	+ DOS
	+ KILL
	+ NORMATIVE	
	+ REG
		
Each folder/sub-folder contains the following set of 13 logs:	

astaire.txt
bono.txt
cassandra.txt
chronos.txt
ellis.txt
homer.txt
homestead.txt
homesteadaccess.txt
homesteadprov.txt
ralf.txt
ralfaccess.txt
sprout.txt
sproutaccess.txt


NOTE:

1) 'Training' logs are used to tune the detection approach presented in the paper. 

2) 'Test' logs are collected within normative/anomalous events. They are used to 
test the proposed approach, and they are collected by means of controlled experiments.

3) Training-Test logs are collected with independent runs of the system in hand.

REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
This repository also provides the regex.txt file, which contains regular expressions used in our study as well as for replication purposes.
